## Hi, Soumya here!

I'm currently a third year undergraduate student in mathematics at Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. My interests are in Algebraic Topology, Algebraic Geometry and Differential Geometry. 

The motivation behind this blog was to share my thoughts on mathematics and my experiences. I should thank Bikram for helping me setting up the website, particularly helping me setting up $\LaTeX$ without which this website wouldn't have been fruitful. 

## Projects

| **Visiting Scientist Research Program (VSRP) at Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR), Mumbai** | {{< badge >}} Summer 2023 {{< /badge >}} |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| I did an online reading project on _Categorical Approach to Covering Spaces_ under Professor Anand Sawant, following the book _Algebraic Topology_ by Tammo tom Dieck. | 

| **Reading Project. New Mexico State University** | {{< badge >}} Summer 2023 {{< /badge >}} |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| I did an online reading project under Professor Prasit Bhattacharya on _Homotopy Theory and Homology Theory_, following the book _A Concise Course in Algebraic Topology_ by Peter J. May. The project aimed to build a foundation for the construction of a Stable Homotopy Category. | 

## Activities

| {{< badge >}} Spring 2024 {{< /badge >}} | **Algebraic Geometry Seminar on Intersection Homology Theory** |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                          | I am participating the Algebraic Geometry Reading Seminar on Intersection Homology Theory organised by Professor Charanya Ravi and Professor Jishnu Biswas from Indian Statistical Institute, Bangalore. More details about the seminar can be found over [here](https://charanyaravi.github.io/Sem2-23-24/Sem2-23-24:IH:index.html).|

| {{< badge >}} 2021-Today {{< /badge >}} | **Math Club ISI** | 
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
|                                         | It is a mathematics community organised and runned by the students of ISI, Bangalore. I have given the following two talks: | 
|                                         | [What is Stable Homotopy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8WCiOJpmTY&list=PL0l3kv-aP9d_FSw08irX60ucY-o_qiy-f&index=5) The talk focused on the motivation behind stable homotopy groups of a space, coming as a consequence of Fruendenthal's theorem. And it explored the connections between geometric problem of classifying manifolds upto cobordism and stable homotopy groups of Thom spectrum. |
|                                         | [Metric Spaces and Isometry Groups.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4rYRrKhr-cE&list=PL0l3kv-aP9d8A3IXvUUKvgFdxix3C9jAv&index=1) It was an introductory talk on metric spaces and concluded with classification of the isometry group of $\mathbb{R}^n$ under the $L^p$ norm. |
 
| {{< badge >}} Summer 2023 {{< /badge >}} |**Undergraduate Directed Group Reading Project (UDGRP)** |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                          | I was mentor of the Algebraic Topology summer reading project during 2023 Summer break. It was a group reading project particularly intended for first and second-year undergraduates. The goal of the project was to motivate the subject of Algebraic Topology through fundamental examples and exercises. | 

| {{< badge >}} Winter 2022 {{< /badge >}} |**Winter Reading Project (WRP)** |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
|                                          | I was mentor of the Topology and Topological Groups winter reading project. It was a group reading project particularly intended for the first and second year undergraduates. |
